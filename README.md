# Chirper - A Twitter Clone

Chirper is a personal project I created to learn and explore Laravel by building a Twitter clone. This project is based on the sample project from the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/), with several additional features to make it more functional and engaging.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using Laravel's built-in authentication.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their chirps and information.
- **Follow System**: Users can follow and unfollow each other to curate their feed.
- **Chirps (Posts)**: Users can create, edit, and delete their chirps. Chirps can include text and media files (images, videos).
- **Like System**: Users can like chirps to show appreciation or agreement.
- **Rechirp (Repost)**: Users can repost chirps with or without adding a comment, similar to Twitter's retweet and quote tweet functionalities.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for likes, reposts, and follows to keep users updated.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for chirps and other accounts.
- **Real-time Updates**: The timeline updates in real-time as users post new chirps or interact with existing ones.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - A PHP framework for building web applications.
- **Frontend**: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Database**: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - An open-source relational database management system.
- **Containerization**: [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail) - A Docker development environment for Laravel.


## Future Enhancements

- **Direct Messaging**: Allow users to send private messages to each other.
- **Advanced Search**: Enhance search functionality with filters and suggestions.

## Acknowledgements

- [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) - The inspiration and foundation for this project.
